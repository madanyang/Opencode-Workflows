description: Generate exhaustive repository guide for assistance
---

Analyze this repository and create an AGENTS.md file for assisting users with setup, running, and troubleshooting. This is NOT for development - it's for user assistance.

First, use web search to find official documentation resources:
- Search for "[repository name] documentation" 
- Look for official docs sites, README links, llms.txt files
- Find getting started guides and API references

Then structure the analysis as:

## Repository Overview
- Software type and purpose
- Main technologies used
- Installation methods

## Official Documentation Resources
- Documentation URLs found via web search
- llms.txt locations if available
- Getting started guides
- API/reference docs

## Key Directory Structure
List only IMPORTANT directories/files with brief descriptions:
- `dir/` - purpose (e.g., "Main source code", "Configuration files", "Documentation")
- `file` - purpose (e.g., "Main entry point", "Configuration file")

Focus on directories/files users would interact with for setup/usage.

## Setup & Installation
- Prerequisites
- Installation commands
- Configuration steps
- Environment variables

## Running & Usage
- Start/launch commands
- Common usage patterns
- CLI commands and flags
- GUI access methods

## Troubleshooting
- Common issues and solutions
- Log locations
- Debug methods
- Configuration validation

## Key Files for Reference
List files that contain important info for user assistance:
- README locations
- Config file examples
- Documentation files
- Script files

Keep it concise - this is for LLM reference, not user documentation. Focus on actionable information for helping users.
