# Opencode Workflows

A collection of Opencode-based command templates, global agent prompts, and
workflow patterns for building sophisticated command-driven projects.

## Currently Included

### Commands2Skills Template

A universal command template with:
- **Command Integration Pattern**: 4-part architecture for command-to-tool interfaces
- **Template Structure**: Organized framework for command-based projects
- **Documentation System**: Automated maintenance via specialized agents
- **Model Compatibility**: Tested with GPT-5.1 series models
- **Example Commands**: Repository exploration and mathematical calculation tools

See `Commands2Skills/README.md` for implementation details, architecture overviews,
and usage guidance.

### Agent Catalog

Reusable agents that pair with Opencode commands:
- **agent-architect** – Refines agents with research-backed prompts (best after running `opencode agent create`).
- **repo-navigator-creator** – Builds lean AGENTS.md navigation guides.
- **subagent-orchestrator** – Dispatches specialists and enforces scope isolation.
- **openspec-orchestrator** – Enforces strict OpenSpec formatting/validation and orchestrates subagents for executing OpenSpec proposals (requires [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) installed and `openspec init`).

All four are designed as primary agents to be installed globally in `~/.config/opencode/agent/`
so they can be reused across projects.

### Commands Catalog

The `Commands/` directory provides shareable command files for Opencode users.
Currently available:
- **`/howto`** (`Commands/.opencode/command/howto.md`): An `/init`-style command that
  scans the cloned repository, searches for official documentation, and generates
  an `AGENTS.md` focused on helping end users set up, operate, and troubleshoot
  the software (not for development work). Run `/howto` right after cloning a repo
  so your assistant knows how to install, run, and support that project.

### Scripts Catalog

The `Scripts/` directory contains utilities that commands or agents can reuse.
- **`perplexica-cli.js`** – Node-based CLI wrapper for Perplexica’s search API
  that handles long-running requests (300s timeout), prints answers with sources,
  and exposes focus modes (web, academic, Reddit, YouTube, Wolfram) via `--mode`
  flags. Point it at your Perplexica instance (default `http://localhost:3000/api/search`). Best used with the `/perplexica-search` command.

### @At Reference Files

Use everything inside `At/` as prefix instructions during development sessions:
- **`@coding-ts`** (`At/CODING-TS.MD`): Universal engineering guidelines emphasizing DRY principles,
  type safety, and clean architecture. Reference it in prompts (e.g., “Implement feature X following @coding-ts principles”) before starting any new feature or refactor so the LLM stays aligned. These reference files are meant for direct @ mentions in user instructions and are not invoked by subagents.

### Other Opencode Projects

- **Agent Swarm Demo** ([repo](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/opencode-agent-swarm-demo)) – Shows how to launch a multi-server
  swarm where Claude Code handles background process management while OpenCode runs specialized agents.
  The swarm orchestrator coordinates inter-agent communication across multiple OpenCode instances and
  currently requires Claude Code because it relies on Claude’s background bash processes to spawn the servers.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Explore `Commands2Skills/` for command templates and tooling patterns.
3. Install desired agents globally (`~/.config/opencode/agent/`) or copy them into
   your project’s `.opencode/agent/` directory.
4. Install [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) and run `openspec init` if you plan to
   use the OpenSpec orchestrator or compatible workflows.

## Additional Documentation
- `Commands2Skills/README.md` – command architecture, tooling integration, and
  usage instructions.
- `Agents/README.md` – agent descriptions, guardrails, and setup guidance.

## About
This repository provides tested Opencode command patterns, global agent prompts,
and workflow templates that demonstrate best practices for creating maintainable,
scalable command-based projects with external tool integration.
